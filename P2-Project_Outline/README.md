### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to properly sort through massive amounts of datapoints in order to determine progress over time for the player object. I have already learned how to make calls to the jagex api and properly store that data into a database. I will also need to learn how to order multiple players progression based on who has the most in the given amount of time.
